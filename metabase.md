title: "Metabase"

The [metabase](metabase.csv) is a CSV derived from the database, of all the known links between admin/mods and other instances.

"Known" is doing a lot of work:

* not all mods are known
* boosts/mentions are samples only
* links expire (this file is currently shorter-term than the one used to generate FedeRater reports)
