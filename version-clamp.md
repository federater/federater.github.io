title: "Version: Clamp"
---
Reports generated by this version list up to ten sites with interactions, ranked by frequency. It's a sample, not a continuous observation, so its accuracy improves over time and new sites are sometimes a bit off.

For the federated timeline, this is just appearances on the fedline - so a huge, noisy site will naturally rank higher. It doesn't mean more local users follow that site, just that that's more likely to be what appears on the fedline.

Emoji:

* 🐘: This is a site. Either nothing is known about it, or it doesn't participate in any of the sub-categories.
* 🦝: This is a garbage site, which tends to be isolated from mainstream federation. It may generate garbage, or just consume it.
* 🧸: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may want to exercise caution in pulling in images from this site.
* 🐦: This site mirrors Twitter posts (on at least one hostname).
* 🤖: This site is all, or mostly bots. (Sometimes beneficial but can fill up the fedline if not silenced.)
* 🪙: This site appears to be cryptocurrency-related.
* 💉: This site appears to be part of a conspiracy-theory cluster (not necessarily antivax, though it's the most common)
* 🐛: This site has been the source of (possibly unintentional) denial-of-service, follow-and-scrape, or other "malicious" behavior.
 
This version has multiple sets of "seed" sites. Some clusters are more cohesive than others, and in particular the coin sites seem to actively avoid each other sometimes.

The bird and bug sites are a special case: all sites are manually flagged, since that's not a "contagious" behavior.

_This is functionally the same as [](/version-pencil) but the terminology "dark fedi" has been changed to "garbage" upon request._
